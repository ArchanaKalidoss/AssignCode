Strategy can be broken down into definitive components, or goals, upon which
individual employees can act. When these goals are made relevant and achievable for
individual employees, they can be aligned to promote successful execution of strategy.}

Cognitive effectiveness is defined as the speed, ease, and accuracy with which a representation can be processed by the human.
Empirical studies in software engineering suggests that decisions about visual representation are far from trivial and should be treated with as much care as decisions about semantics.
Designers repeat the same pattern over and over again because they lack an understanding of the principles required to generate new ones.
Ontological analysis involves a two-way mapping between a modeling notation and an ontology. The interpretation mapping describes the mapping from the notation to the ontology, while the representation mapping describes the inverse mapping. There should be one-to-one mapping between ontological concepts and notation constructs. Construct deficit, construct overload, construct redundancy and construct excess are the deviations that may occur when there is no one-to-one mapping.

Modularization :
UML lacks a consistent approach to complexity management: different diagram types have different ways of dealing with complexity, while some diagram types (e.g class diagrams) have none at all.

Principle of dual coding: Including graphics and text is likely to improve understanding by people across the full spectrum of spatial and verbal abilities. Empirical studies show that graphic complexity significantly reduces understanding of SE diagrams by novices.}

  review =    {Informal processes are typically enacted by human performer, these processes are typically hard to model and predict beforehand. This paper presents the concept of Informal Process Essentials, which defines a meta-model to specify all information required to enact informal processes except their actual business logic. Business logic of informal process is based on decisions of human performers. Also by describing the corresponding decision makers, we implicitly design the business logic of an informal process.Traditional workflows are based on the activity oriented preocess models and executed based on these models.
Properties of Informal Processes : 1. The business logic of informal process is not explicitly defined before the enactment. 2. There are various relationships between different resources depending on the context, in which the resource is considered. 3. Each of the resources can collaborate with multiple resources. 4. Set of human resources of informal process can change after initialization.

Requirements for supporting informal processes : 
1. Executable modeling of informal processes i.e informal processes need to be first represented so that they can be executed and improved afterwards based on the corresponding representations.
2. Resource Relationships Defintion : We need a means to define custom as well as generic relationships between the resources of an informal process.
3. Resource visibility definition : all resource of na informal process can be made visible in the process representation, and for related resources to a resource can be made visible.
4. Means to add and remove resources at modeling time and even dynamically at runtime from thr corresponding informal process representations.

Literature review and evaluation of related work:

1. Traditional workflows do not focus on the visibility of the resources in a process, rather they focus on the visibility of individual work items contained in a process.

Activity-oriented approaches describe the process based on its activities whereas decision-oriented models focus on the goals of processes.
ArchiMate provides an integrated modeling approach. Using ArchiMate, one can describe processes based on both activities, i.e., business processes and based on competencies, knowledge, and resources i.e., business functions.

Informal Process Essentials : The intention -based approach enables describing process declartively, i.e., without describing how the intention is achieved, and providing only information about what has to be achieved. Thus we can avoid predefined business logic in the representations of informal processes.

By using the IPE meta-model, informal processes are modeled in an as-is fashion. i.e., the focus is not on business logic as it is not previously defined, rather the focus is on other dimensions, e.g., resources. The non-existence of business logic results in a resource-centric approach and facilitates more autonomy for human performers and enables establishment of best practices.},

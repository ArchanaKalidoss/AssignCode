\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

As said by Simon Mainwaring  \footnote{http://www.azquotes.com/author/9307-Simon\_Mainwaring}  "Creating a better world requires teamwork, partnerships, and collaboration, as we need an entire army of companies to work together to build a better world within the next few decades. This means corporations must embrace the benefits of cooperating with one another.", every organization knows the benefits in co-acting a process to achieve its desired intention. Resources of an organization play an important role to collaborate and accomplish those tasks. Though organizations re-use data resources and tool resources during this collaboration work, business logics and decisions cannot be reused in certain types of processes. These type of processes are not structured like traditional processes because the process execution steps cannot be pre-defined due to its dynamic nature e.g processes that require involvement of human knowledge in deciding the execution steps\cite{Sungur2014}. Such type of processes are called \textit{Informal Processes}.

Humans play an important role in informal processes which makes the informal processes collaborative in nature. The participants of an informal processes collaborate to accomplish a task. These participants are the resources that drives towards the accomplishment of the task.  Developing an editor to create models for such \textit{resource-centric informal processes} is a part of realizing the automated execution of informal processes. In this document, we explain how we realized developing an editor that creates models for resource-centric informal processes. Also we validate the developed prototype using a case study. This case study has been taken as an example scenario throughout this document that helps for better understanding of the concepts.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%% You have to demonstrate what you have done in your research, why it is relevant, and what about it is new.
%%Explanation of why you had to and what you did

Any task today has both well defined, predictable elements and less defined, more ambiguous elements where knowledge workers has power to implement their decisions\footnote{White, Michael. "Case management: Combining knowledge with process." BPTrends, July (2009).}. For example, research and development projects are of these type where, \textit{what to do next} cannot be decided much in advance. These type of processes are highly unpredictable in nature and this makes it quite challenging to support and automate these type of processes. This diploma thesis is a part in realizing the automation of such processes. These \textit{unstructured/informal/human-centric processes} are called as \textit{informal processes}\cite{Sungur2014}. Any approach that supports informal process is required to be more autonomous because of their dynamic behavior of enacting a process, so the existing approaches available for traditional processes are not helpful in realizing the execution of informal processes.  


Though the execution steps of informal processes cannot be determined beforehand, \textit{intentions} of informal processes are known before their enactment \cite{Sungur2015}. Achieving these intentions requires another important driving force \textit{resources}, which can be anything from human actors, development environment, material resources etc. These resources has to posses certain \textit{capabilities} to qualify for executing the process. So we need an approach that supports informal processes along with the support of intentions, required resources, capabilities etc. This can be achieved by associating intentions with strategies, strategies with capabilities and informal processes and informal processes with resources. In extension to the work of Sungur et. al. \cite{Sungur2014a} where a meta-model and an overview of solution architecture has been presented, this work  focuses to provide web based  editor to create resource-centric models of organizations. The reason for selecting meta-model approach is to preserve the essential information associated with informal processes such as intentions, context information, resource definitions etc.  This work also provides means to initialize and acquire instances which can be further extended during enactment of resource-centric informal processes.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemstatement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 Every organization contains multiple entities like resources e.g humans, tools etc., intentions e.g revenue based intentions,quarterly intentions etc., strategies e.g the process to achieve the intention and capabilities e.g a resource that can provide a particular capability. Thus an organization needs efficient mechanisms to handle and manage these different types of entities. Though there are some existing tools which provide facility to manage resources in an organizations, they act either as a \textit{Retrieval Service} i.e they are used only to view or retrieve resource engagers for resources or as an \textit{Control Service} i.e they are used to run resource engagers \cite{Sungur2015}. But there is not a service which provides both mechanism to retrieve and initiate the instances of each entities.
 
  The research work by Matthews et. al \cite{Matthews2011}  clearly points out below as the major problems in adopting to a workspace collaboration tools.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lack of Methods
	\item Methods that focus on individuals
	\item Not well targeted groups
	\item Not well supported editors for executing abstract descriptions
\end{enumerate}

Though there are \textit{activity-centric} modeling and reusing of business processes such as Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) \footnote{http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsbpel/2.0/OS/wsbpel-v2.0-OS.pdf} and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) \footnote{http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF/} are available, they are not suitable for certain type processes whose execution steps cannot be predicted in advance \cite{Sungur2014a}. Also complementary concepts such as automatic initialization and acquiring of interrelated resources are still missing in the existing work \cite{Sungur2015}. Another key thing to remember is informal processes are volatile in nature which is one of the important reason for challenges in developing an environment that supports informal processes.

\section {Research Objectives}
\label{sec:researchobjectives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The main focus of this diploma thesis, is to realize the phase \textit{Informal Process Modeling} described in approach \textit{Exceuting Informal Processes (InProXec)} mentioned by Sungur et al. \cite{Sungur2015}. Coupled with the main focus during the development web editor the following research objectives provided in the Table \ref{tab:researchobjectives} were also satisfied.

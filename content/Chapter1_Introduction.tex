\chapter{Introduction}
\label{chap:introduction}

Resources of an organization play an important role to accomplish its intentions. Though organizations reuse resources, stored execution procedure of successfully completed processes, etc., the decisions that involve human knowledge cannot be reused in certain types of processes. These type of processes are not structured like traditional processes because the sequence of activities to be carried out in order to execute a process cannot be pre-defined due to its dynamic changing nature e.g research and development process.

The processes whose required activities and order of their execution cannot be determined beforehand are called \textit{Informal Processes} \cite{Sungur2014}. These type of processes are human-centric as their dynamic nature is due to the involvement of human knowledge. The next section provides a detailed motivational statement of this master thesis work followed by problem statement section which is then followed by contributions of this work. The final section provides an outline about the following chapters of the document.

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Nowadays, any task has both well defined predictable traditional processes and less defined ambiguous informal processes. In tasks with less defined ambiguous processes, knowledge workers' decision plays an important role \cite{BPTrends2009}. For example, research and development projects are of type where \textit{what to do next} cannot be decided in advance. These type of processes are highly unpredictable in nature and this makes it quite challenging to support and automate these type of processes. This work is a part in realizing the automation of such processes. Any approach that supports informal process automation is required to be more autonomous because of their dynamic behavior of processes are enacted by some subjects, so the existing approaches available for traditional processes are not helpful in realizing the execution of informal processes.  

Though sequence of steps to be carried out to execute informal processes cannot be determined beforehand, \textit{intentions} of informal processes are known before their enactment \cite{Sungur2015}. Achieving these intentions requires another important driving force called \textit{resources}. Resources can be anything from human actors, development environments, materials etc. These resources posses certain \textit{capabilities} to qualify for achieving an intention. So we need an approach that supports informal processes along with the support of intentions, resources, capabilities etc. This can be achieved by associating intentions with strategies, strategies with capabilities and capabilities with resources, i.e., modeling oriented to organizational intentions. When the models are designed descriptively, i.e., providing only information what has to be done in order to achieve an intention rather than how to achieve an intention they serve as informal guides which preserves the essential information associated with informal processes to achieve an intention. Meanwhile, it also overcomes the need for pre-defining the sequence of execution steps.

\section{Problem Statement}
\label{sec:problemstatement}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
 Every organization contains multiple entities like \textit{resources} e.g., humans, tools etc., \textit{intentions} e.g., revenue based intentions, quarterly intentions etc., \textit{strategies} e.g., the process to achieve the intention and \textit{capabilities} e.g., a resource that can provide a particular capability. Thus an organization needs efficient mechanisms to handle and manage these different types of entities. Informal processes are collaborative in nature, which means that participants of informal process collaborate with each other to accomplish its intentions\cite{Sungur2015}. Designing these collaborations and assigning participants their respective privileges, plays an important role during modeling of the respective informal processes. The research work by Matthews et. al \cite{Matthews2011} mentions that below points are the major problems in adopting to a workspace collaboration tools.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Lack of Methods
	\item Methods that focus on individuals
	\item Not well targeted groups
	\item Not well supported editors for executing abstract descriptions
\end{enumerate}

Though there are \textit{activity-centric} modeling and reusing of business processes such as Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) \footnote{http://docs.oasis-open.org/wsbpel/2.0/OS/wsbpel-v2.0-OS.pdf} and Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) \footnote{http://www.omg.org/spec/BPMN/2.0/PDF/} are available, they are not suitable for certain type processes whose execution steps cannot be predicted in advance \cite{Sungur2014a}. Also complementary concepts such as automatic initialization and acquiring of interrelated resources are still missing in the existing work \cite{Sungur2015}. Another key thing to remember is informal processes are volatile in nature which is one of the important challenges in developing an environment that supports informal processes.

\section {Research Objectives}
\label{sec:researchobjectives}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The main focus of this work, is to realize the phase \textit{Informal Process Modeling} (P2) described in \textit{Executing Informal Processes} (InProXec) method \cite{Sungur2015}. Coupled with the main focus of developing web based editor, the following research objectives provided in the Table \ref{tab:researchobjectives} are also satisfied by the developed editor.

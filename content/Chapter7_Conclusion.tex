\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

In this document, we first provided the motivational statement and problem statement of this master thesis work. We also provided, the fundamental concepts and related work from the existing literatures to aid the reader in understanding the concepts of intention-oriented organizational modeling. We then provided a motivating scenario taken from a manufacturing organization and explained it based on the guidelines and real life scenarios discussed in the existing literatures. This helps in understanding, the requirements of intention-oriented organizational modeling derived from existing literatures. The derived requirements were evaluated against few of the existing approaches. Since none of the considered approaches satisfied all of the requirements, we proposed a new approach that satisfied all of the requirements. We then provided a detailed case study on a manufacturing company. The case study helped to assess the feasibility of the proposed approach. A web-based modeling tool was developed to realize the proposed approach. The usability of the approach in the organizations was also confirmed by creating models for the motivating scenario through the developed modeling tool.  

To be more precise, this work provided an approach that satisfied all of the requirements of the intention-oriented organizational modeling and realized the proposed approach as a web-based modeling tool. The models developed through this approach act as an informal guide for accomplishing intention-oriented organizational modeling, i.e., provides information required for intention-oriented organizational modeling.

The web-based modeling tool developed as a part of this master thesis work, will be integrated with the back end such that the created models can be initialized. The future work also includes providing mobile modeling approach, enabling logging in functionality through few of the popular social network accounts and enhancing the user interface features of the modeling tool.

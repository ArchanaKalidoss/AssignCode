\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{chap:conclusion}

There exists an overhead to configure, coordinate and engage different resources without automation during initialization. For example in our motivating scenario \ref{chap:motivatingScenario}, one of the sub-intention is to improve the help desk for answering consumer queries. One of the strategy to achieve this sub-intention is providing facility to automatically record and answer some of the known basic queries from the consumer.  To develop such an automatic help desk software we need different IT services and software developers need to be assigned and tasks has to be initiated. Though existing automation standards such as BPEL suggest to avoid such overhead by acquiring interrelated resources in priori, such complementary concepts of automatic initialization are still missing in this work         \cite{Sungur2015}.

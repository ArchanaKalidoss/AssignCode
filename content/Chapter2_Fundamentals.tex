\chapter{Fundamentals and Related Work}
\label{chap:fundamentals}
The first three sections of this chapter are the fundamental concepts that are required to understand the approach to be discussed in the following Chapter \ref{chap:approach}. The fourth section provides a brief introduction about related work Informal Process Essentials (IPE) approach, as the conceptual model described in the fifth section is adapted from IPE approach. The final section is also a related work because this thesis work is part of the phase P2 of the Executing Informal Processes (InProXec) method which helps to realize IPE approach in organizations.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, the definitions of terminologies that are used throughout this document are provided briefly.

\textit{Business Process} -  A business process has been defined as set of activities whose final output is accomplishment of a goal \cite{Weske2012}.  

\textit{Business Logic} - Business logic refers to the activities that need to be done to execute the corresponding business process. 

\textit{Business Process Model} - Business process model is a model to capture recurring activities during business process execution and enact them in an automated fashion for re-using the stored knowledge. 

\textit{Informal Process Essentials} - Informal Process Essentials (IPE) is a resource-driven approach that enables describing process declaratively, i.e., without describing how the intention is achieved and providing only information about what has to be achieved \cite{Sungur2014a}.

\section{Human Centric Process}
\label{sec:humancentric}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The role of humans in organizations has been evolving over time. The shift from "personnel" to "human resources" acknowledges the importance of humans as organizational resources. There is an incredible number of pressure on today's organizations \cite{May2016} due to dynamic nature of organizations. For example, organizational changes like addition of new organizational alliances, new structures and hierarchies, new ways of assigning work and a very high rate of changes like changes in the workforce, including employees' priorities, capabilities, and demographic characteristics. Thus, it is impossible to do one hundred percent perfect forecasting of dynamically changing processes in an organization.

In order to manage such a dynamic environment, organizations need skilled human resources with previous knowledge of handling unforeseen scenarios. Thus human resources are vital part of any organizations as they have skills of acute future orientation to understand changing organizational environment. Humans in organizations carry out many important activities. Managers and Human Resource (HR) professionals organize jobs of each and every human in the organization so that they can effectively perform these jobs. Thus, humans in any organization are viewed as resources of the organization which is a contemporary part of Human Resource Management \cite{Bianca2016}.

Collaboration exists in every levels of an organization. For example at management levels of an organization, managers and HR professionals work together to assign employees their roles and task in the organization. This helps the employees of the organization to adapt to its environment. In a flexible organization, employees' roles and responsibilities changes dynamically based on the requirements and business priorities. Thus the need for network of representations between the human resources is arising. This network of representation sets up an environment to support collaborative work of business related process. This kind of support to represent human resource network has been realized in the work by author Canko \cite{Canko2015}. The concept of \textit{virtual human representation} described by author is an extension of actor-concept described in \textit{Informal Process Essentials} \cite{Sungur2014a}. The developed prototype \textit{Human Resource Representation} in a work \cite{Canko2015} saves the information such as capabilities, roles, responsibilities etc., as a virtual human web ontology instance which can be re-used in web based environments. These kind of human representation are highly helpful to organizations with dynamically changing resources. These representations can describe and match resources with their capabilities based on the requirements.

\section{Organizational Modeling Notations}
\label{sec:resourcecentricorganizationalmodeling}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The organizational modeling element notation has been selected based on the guidelines mentioned in the literature \cite{Moody2009} and these notations are adopted from another thesis work \cite{Sierr2015}. Though these notations modeling are not part of this master thesis, this is provided in this section for the sole purpose of aiding the reader to understand the concepts better through pictorial representations. Also by observing  the fact that business process modelers are already well-known with the present process modeling notations such as Business Process Modeling Notation 2.0 (BPMN) \cite{bpm2011} and ArchiMate notation\cite{arc2013}, the shape depiction of organizational model elements has been designed similar to those existing process notations. 

Due to the importance of shapes in expressing information visually, the notations are chosen in such a way that each element of organizational notations differ by shape. Also a legend holding respective name of each notation is shown in the following images to denote the meaning of each shape. The description of each element in the organizational model notation is shown in the Table \ref{tab:notations}.

\section{Overview of Informal Process Essentials}
\label{sec:basicconcepts}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we provide an overview about the concepts introduced in the approach Informal Process Essentials (IPE) \cite{Sungur2014a}. As mentioned earlier, the modeling elements of the proposed approach in the following Chapter \ref{chap:approach} is adapted from IPE approach. Hence IPE approach serves as an important related work required to understand the proposed approach and conceptual model discussed in this document. 

The execution steps of an informal process are recorded as models. These models can be represented as graphs, state machine diagrams, linguistic descriptions, etc. Models are used in various fields like manufacturing, scientific, IT, etc. These models are mainly useful in re-using the predefined solutions. Such models have numerous benefits \cite{Indulska2009} like process performance improvement, understanding of the process, model-driven process execution etc. The performance of informal processes depend on dynamic nature of human knowledge i.e., they are subject to change and carried out based on experience of previous knowledge. 

The authors describe following as the properties of an informal process (1) business logic of informal processes is not defined explicitly before the enactment, (2) informal processes are collaborative in nature which requires resources with interrelationships (3) a resource can participate in multiple informal processes and (4) resources can change dynamically.

The authors also provide following requirements that support informal processes with the above described properties. The summarized requirements are (1) ability to represent informal process as models and ability to execute it, (2) due to involvement of multiple resources, ability to define relationships among the resources, (3) resources should be visible in process representations and (4) support for dynamically changing resources. 

The authors also compare existing approaches in the literature with the above requirements. It has also been concluded that analyzed approaches only satisfies some of the requirements but not all the requirements completely. So the authors propose a new \textit{meta-model} approach that satisfies all the requirements. In this IPE meta-model approach, resources are related to each other and work towards achievement of an intention, i.e., a goal.   

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:termdefinitions}, resources are drivers to achieve intentions in the informal processes. In the IPE approach, author states that when the desired process result is repeated the same set of resources can be selected and engaged towards collective intention of the informal processes. It has been mentioned in the IPE approach that Informal Process Essentials (IPE) meta-model describes the following about informal process: (1) describes the constituents informal process such as performers, data and software tools and (2) describes how to make core element ready for the enactment of the informal process i.e resource providers. IPE models begin from initial context and after achieving the main intention it results in another context. The relationship between IPE approach and conceptual model of intention-oriented organizational modeling is explained in the next section.

\section{Intention-oriented Organizational Modeling - Conceptual Model}
\label{sec:entitytypesrepresentation}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The conceptual model of organizational modeling elements used in intention-oriented organizational modeling is shown in the Figure \ref{fig:entitymodel}. This conceptual model shows that intention contains multiple strategies. An intention can be achieved through a strategy, which is a plan of action designed to meet the intention. Strategies require capabilities and contain process models to realize strategies. The capabilities can be further resolved into resources. Thus starting from defining intentions, we define strategies then required capabilities and IPE models. The capabilities and process models define the required resources. 

Organizational process modeling of this approach is an \textit{intention-oriented} as they support modeling based on intention and required resources thrive to successfully achieve organizational intention by using qualified autonomous agents, i.e., actors under certain \textit{context definitions}. As we mentioned before, in our context resources can be anything like people, IT tools, data that are used to accomplish the objectives. Emerging intentions can result in the requirement of new capabilities, i.e., an ability required to achieve an intention. Resource models are also provided in the developed prototype to make precise definitions of resources needed.

	\caption{Intention-oriented Organizational Modeling - Conceptual Model}
	\label{fig:entitymodel}
\end{figure}

The concept of \textit{Informal Process Support Model} (IPSM) \cite{Sungur2014a} has been introduced which is to make use existing knowledge of human performers. In this approach, the initial creator of a model is experienced human performers such as business experts. Based on their experience, they add relevant resources of an informal process. The models are generated at runtime based on the interactions and activities of corresponding human performers. An informal process targets for accomplishment of an intention. The intentions can be refined by defining strategies, which can then be further refined recursively as independent informal processes. The intention-based approach enables describing processes declaratively, i.e., without describing \textit{how} the intention is achieved, and providing only information about \textit{what} is achieved. The IPE approach \cite{Sungur2014a} suggests that this avoids need of predefined business logic in the representations of informal processes. Each resource can be related to another resource in the context of an informal process using predefined or custom \textit{Relationships}. Informal Process Essentials are realized through strategies. Each informal process starts from an initial context, i.e., \textit{initial context} and aims to achieve an intention. After accomplishing the intention, there is a resulting context called as \textit{final context}. The beginning state before achieving intention is called as initial context and the end state after achieving intention is called as final context. On completion of intention execution, the process state changes from one state to another.

\section{Executing Informal Processes}
\label{sec:inproxec}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
In this section, we present an overview about the \textit{Executing Informal Processes} (InProXec) method \cite{Sungur2015}. Implementing IPE approach in organization requires the application of InProXec with different phases. The InProXec method enables modeling of informal processes and automated provisioning of resources modeled in these processes. Since this thesis work is realizing intention-oriented modeling of organizations, the main focus of this section is on the second phase of InProXec which is \textit{Model Informal Process} (P2). The method described in Figure \ref{fig:inprocxec_steps}, initializes informal process models in an automated fashion. The author also proves feasibility of the approach with a suitable case study. In the following paragraphs, a short overview about different phases of the InProXec method has been provided and with a detailed description about the second phase of the \textit{InProXec} method is provided in the Section \ref{sec:informalprocessmodeling} of Chapter \ref{chap:approach}. 

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width= \textwidth]{InProXec_Steps.pdf}
	\caption{Steps of the InProXec approach}
	\label{fig:inprocxec_steps}
\end{figure} 

As shown in the Figure \ref{fig:inprocxec_steps} adapted from the InProXec approach, the InProcXec method consists of three different phases:

\textit{Integrate Resources of Informal Processes (P1)} - The first phase aims for creating the required infrastructure to enable modeling and automated initialization of informal processes. This is because the required modeling tools of informal processes modeling has to be presented to  business experts that are required for the next phase P2. So the required resource definitions for informal process modeling are allocated by \textit{execution environment integrators} developed by technical experts during this phase. The final output of this phase is \textit{resources definitions} which are used by next phase P2. 

\textit{Model Informal Processes (P2)} - This phase makes use of resource definitions made available in the first phase P1.  Based on this resource definitions, business experts can create informal process models. This phase has been explained in detail in the following Section \ref{sec:informalprocessmodeling} of Chapter \ref{chap:approach}

\textit{Execute Informal Processes (P3)} - Initialization of models developed in phase P2 happens automatically using execution environment integrators developed in phase P1. When an IPE Model is compiled and engaged with resources, it results in successful initialization. This successful initialization results in an IPE Model Instance. A model instance contains additional meta-data about executed processes such as the information about start time, history of the resource model, time of changes made etc. In phase P2, the functionality to instantiate acquirable entities are not included. Thus in third phase P3, the informal process models of phase P2 is taken and transformed into initialize-able self-contained \textit{Deployable Informal Process Essentials Archives(DIPEA)} \cite{Sungur2015} takes place. This results in DIPEAs enacting required informal process. To realize, phase P3 an \textit{IPE Model Compiler} also been introduced in the approach. Additionally, this phase also employs \textit{IPE Runtime} which parses DIPEAs and runs the executables contained in those archives. During this phase, the autonomous actors work towards intentions of informal processes using acquired resources and other involved resources.

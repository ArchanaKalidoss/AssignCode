\chapter{Realization of Intention-centric Organizational Modeling}
\label{chap:realization}
\hspace{4ex} This chapter discusses about how Intention-centric organizational modeling realized as an user interface editor. This also explains the realization of requirements described in Chapter 4. In the first section, we will first discuss the overview of basic concepts and then specify the design components required for the realization of this editor. The next section discusses about how the entity views in particular are realized. The last section covers in detail how individual requirement has been realized through the web editor.

\subsection{MVC Architecture}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\hspace{4ex} The architecture of the UI editor is based on the \textbf{Model-View-Control (MVC)} design pattern. The MVC paradigm allows to separate business logic from the code that controls presentation and event handling \cite{Oracle2016}.Each entity view in the web page is made up of combination of at least on Model and View, and one or more Controls.  

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Model}
\item \textbf{View}
\item \textbf{Control}	
\end{itemize}
